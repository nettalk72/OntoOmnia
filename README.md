## What is OntoOmnia? | 온토옴니아란?
OntoOmnia is the supreme integrator, ethical consensus engine, and “final arbiter” for the OntoMesh/Branch/OS ecosystem.  
It serves as the meta-level hub for collective critique, consensus, and mesh-wide reorganization when necessary.

**온토옴니아는 OntoMesh 세계관의 최고 통합자(오시리스에 해당)**  
— 전체 메타 계층, 비판·윤리·합의·재구성의 권한과 책임을 갖는 “최종 조정자”입니다.
